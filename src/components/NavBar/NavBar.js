//not sure how to format/write a navbar, but this will be where it goes once I figure that out
//I think maybe instead of having many different HTML pages display based on links in a navbar,
//it might be better to have the rendered content vary based on what is selected in the navbar.
//the base index.html page will be static, but the content ontop is going to be dynamic.

//NavBar component will be styled based on the current image being displayed
